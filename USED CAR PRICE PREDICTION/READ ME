Project Title: Used Car Price Prediction

*Overview*:
This project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle to perform data cleaning, data selection for California, clustering to form different groups, and regression techniques to predict car prices.

Instructions:

Data Collection: The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, price, and location.

Data Cleaning: We perform data cleaning tasks to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies or errors in the data, ensuring the data quality and reliability.

Data Selection: We filter the dataset to focus on cars located in California, extracting only the relevant data for further analysis.

Clustering: We apply clustering algorithms, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group similar cars together based on their features, to identify patterns or segments within the data.

Regression Analysis: We use regression techniques, to predict car prices based on their features. We build regression models using selected features as predictors and car prices as the target variable, and evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the models.

Analysis and Interpretation: We analyze the results of clustering and regression analysis to gain insights and interpret the data, understanding the different groups of cars and their characteristics, and identifying significant predictors of car prices in the California market.

Visualization and Communication: We use data visualization techniques, such as plots, charts, and graphs, to visually represent our findings and communicate the results to stakeholders or team members.
